# Setting Up The Development Environment

## Language And Frameworks

The FritzBot is written in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp), using the [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) framework v3.0 targetting [ASP.net core](https://asp.net). It is also written as a [Blazor](https://blazor.net) project.

## Tooling

Any development environment or editor which can work with C# and Dotnet Core will do. The recommended development environment is [Visual Studio][]. That can be either [Visual Studio Code][] (aka VSCode) and [Visual Studio][Visual Studio for PC] (any edition). [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac) does not yet support developing [Blazor][] projects. So if you are on a Mac, [Visual Studio Code][] is your best option.

If you prefer an alternate editor or <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>, please make sure that it can make use of, and respect, the project file settings and preferences specified in an [.editorconfig][] file
