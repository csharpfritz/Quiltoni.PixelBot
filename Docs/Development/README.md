# Quiltoni.PixelBot Development Documentation

If you are looking for information on how to configure and use the bot for your own channel, these are not the docs you're looking for. Instead, refer to the topmost [README.md](../../README.md).

If, however, you are looking for information on how to contribute to the development of the bot, you've come to the right place. Here is an index of what's available...

* [GettingStarted.md](GettingStarted.md): A quick **tl;dr** to quickly get up and running to develop on the bot

* [NGrok.md](NGrok.md): A rudimentory explanation of the [NGrok][] client and its purpose

* [Contributing.md](Contributing.md): Information on contributing to the bot, including the pull-request process.
