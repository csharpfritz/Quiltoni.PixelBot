# FritzBot Development Documentation

If you are looking for information on how to configure and use the bot for your own channel, these are not the docs you're looking for. Instead, refer to the topmost [README.md][Main README].

If, however, you are looking for information on how to contribute to the development of the bot, you've come to the right place. Here is an index of what's available...

* [GettingStarted.md](GettingStarted.md): A quick **tl;dr** to quickly get up and running to develop on the bot, and folow links within it for more detailed step-by-step instructions.
* [ngrok.md](ngrok.md): A rudimentory explanation of the [ngrok][] client and its purpose
* [Contributing.md](Contributing.md): Information on contributing to the bot, including the pull-request process.
* [Environment.md](Environment.md): Information concerning the environment setup for development. *i.e.*: Environment variables, paths, etc.
* [BuildingAndRunningLocally.md][]: How to build the code locally and then run it.
