# Twitch.tv Setup and Requirements

## Reference

For information about any of the [Twitch][] APIs or systems, refer to the [Twitch Developer Documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/)

## Create a Twitch.TV account

To create a [Twitch][] account, click on the **Sign Up** button in the upper right-hand corner of any page on the [Twitch.tv][Twitch] site. While not necessary, it is highly recommended that you create and maintain a separate and additional account which will be used by the bot.

## Generate a Client Access Key

After creating an account with sign-on credentials for [Twitch][], the next step is to generate a token which will be used during development to connect to the [Twitch][] service.

The easiest and generally recommended method to generate a token to interact with Twitch is to use the [Twitch Chat Token Generator][]. This is a tool written and maintained by the development community to simplify the generation and maintenance of tokens for [Twitch][] interactions.
